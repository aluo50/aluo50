DISCO:

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: It took a couple of major rewrites in order to make it conform to the project. From there it took some bug fixing and that was it
q1: When running the app, the AI had incorrectly used tools like a cypher (which is funny because we didn't even ask the AI for a cypher). It took some extra prompts to get it right.
q2: Pretty similar. I was surprised that the bot instantly upon first prompt created all of the HTML templates with similar names that we used on the project.
c1: copilot wouldn't respond unless if I let it access public code
c2: copilot added multiline comment symbols around all generated code: ```[code]```
c3: when sending a prompt with a large project/many requests (broad), copilot when typically fail to correctly address all points
C4: told us to use SQLAlchemy and a cypher that didn't even work
