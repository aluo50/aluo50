Devo nation: create a flask app that is a weblog hosting site that allow users to register and login. Once they are logged in they will be able to create a new blog, update their blog by adding a new entry, view and edit their own past entry, and view the blogs of other users. They will not be able edit other users blogs. SQLite3 will serve as the backend data storage system. :
AI:Below is the implementation of a Flask web application that meets the requirements specified: -proceeds to give me all of the code in separate files-
Devo naton:jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'User' is undefined Line 44 return render_template('home.html', user=user, blogs=blogs) is returning this error. How can I fix the error?
AI:The error jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'User' is undefined occurs because the user variable is not properly defined or passed to the template in the home route when the user is not logged in. To fix this, ensure that the user variable is always defined and passed to the template, even when the user is not logged in. -proceeds to send updated home route-
Devo nation:sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: User.email Line 56 in register cursor.execute('INSERT INTO User (username, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (username, email, hashed_password)) is returning an error. How can I fix this?
AI:The error sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: User.email occurs because you are trying to insert a new user with an email that already exists in the database, which violates the UNIQUE constraint on the email column. -proceeds to fix register route-
Devo nation:jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'User' is undefined {% for other_user in User.query.filter(User.id != user.id).all() %} produces the error above from the home template
AI:The error jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'User' is undefined occurs because the User model is not available in the template context. In your current Flask setup, you are using raw SQLite queries, which do not directly provide the ORM functionality of SQLAlchemy. -proceeds to fix home once again-
Devo nation: error arises from line 145 in view blog: return render_template('view_blog.html', blog=blog)
AI:The error jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'tuple object' has no attribute 'date_posted' occurs because you are accessing blog.date_posted as if it were an attribute of an object, but it is actually a tuple returned from the SQLite query. -proceeds to fix view_blog-
Devo nation: create a readme.md file for this project
AI: -proceeds to write readme-
Devo nation: Please fix the login route such that it works. Also please make sure all users will be able to view all blogs (their own and other peoples blogs), and also, when a user edits his blogs, he should just be able to click edit on the entity of that blog he wants to edit. Also please add styling to the site in a styles.css - make a modern green and blue with box shadowing and a nav bar. Also make sure the routes work and are integrated correctly.  -with app attached-
AI: Below is an example of a complete update to the project that addresses your requirements. -sends unrelated javascript-
